Genetic Algorithm for Fantasy Soccer Drafts
===========================================

This is an implementation of a classic Genetic algorithm which uses a combination of roulette wheel and elitist selection, mutation and crossover to generate a draft fantasy soccer team. The fitness function is based on player value and previous gameweek scores

###Command
```python GeneticFantasy.py```

It reads in data from four csv files corresponding to Goalkeepers, Defenders, Midfielders and Forwards and it is also possible to write data to analyze fitness (objective function) against other performance factors like next gameweek scores etc.
